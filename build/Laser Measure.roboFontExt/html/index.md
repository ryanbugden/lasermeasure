# Laser Measure

To get the measurements of the current selection. Press and hold `d`.
The width and height of the current selection will be displayed in
an outlined rectangle.

To dynamically measure items, press and hold `d` and move the cursor
to what you want to measure. The found width and height will be
displayed in a filled rectangle. These are the things that are
dynamically measured:

- **Segments** To get the width and height of a segment: hover over
  the segment. Other segments with the same width and height will
  be highlighted.
- **Off Curve Handles** To get the width and height of a handle:
  hover over a handle. Other handles with the same width and height
  will be highlighted.
- **Two On Curve Points** To get the width and height between two
  points, hover between the two points. (Only points with angles of
  +/- 20Â° from right angles will be shown.)
- **Outline Intersection** To get the width and height between the
  nearest outline lines, hover between the lines you want to measure.
- **Exterior of Outline and Metrics** To get the distance between the
  exterior of glyph's outline and the closest horizontal and vertical
  metrics, hover between the outline and the metrics you want to measure.
- **Exterior of Metrics and Outline Bounds** To get the distance between
  the exterior of glyph's outline and glyph's bounding box, hold option
  and hover outside of glyph's outline.
- **Anchor and Outline** To get the distance between an anchor and a
  glyph's outline, hover between the anchor and the outline.
- **Anchor and Metrics** To get the distance between an anchor and a
  glyph's metrics, hover between the anchor and the metrics.
- **Anchor and Outline Bounds** To get the distance between an anchor
  and a glyph's bounding box, hold option and hover between the anchor
  and the glyph's outline.
